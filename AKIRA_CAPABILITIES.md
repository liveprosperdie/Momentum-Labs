---

## 3. 👑 Pro Tier (The Flagship Autonomous AI Suite)

*The apex tier of Akira. Built for power users and engineers who demand true agentic autonomy, non-blocking asynchronous multi-tasking, deep architectural comprehension, multimodal document synthesis, AI-powered content generation, and self-governing reliability.*

### What Akira Can Do on Pro Tier (Includes All Standard Tier Features Plus:)

#### 🚀 1. True Non-Blocking Async Multi-Tasking Daemon
* **Zero Dead Air**: Heavy, compute-intensive operations (codebase analysis, vault structuring, document generation, multi-repo cloning) are dispatched to background daemon threads (`background_tasks.py`).
* **Parallel Conversational Flow**: You can continue issuing commands, browsing, or asking questions seamlessly while Akira executes long-running operations in the background.
* **Thread-Safe Spoken Announcements**: Once background tasks complete, Akira automatically announces the finished artifacts cleanly through the main audio loop without interrupting active speech.
* **Live Task Monitoring (`background_status`)**: Real-time voice query status (*"How's that repo analysis going?"*, *"Is my document ready?"*).

#### 🧠 2. Deep GitHub Codebase Architectural Ingestion (`repo notes`)
* **Full-Repository Ingestion**: Clones and analyzes entire production codebases in the background.
* **Intelligent File Filtering**: Automatically strips locks, vendor trees, and build artifacts (`node_modules`, `dist`, `.git`, lockfiles).
* **Multi-Stage Code Synthesis**:
  1. Identifies entry points and high-level architectural patterns.
  2. Batches source files through high-speed mechanical summarization.
  3. Synthesizes an architectural blueprint and outline (`plan_repo_outline`).
  4. Generates an entire, deeply interconnected technical documentation vault into Obsidian (`write_note_bodies`) with wikilinks and component diagrams.

#### 🗂️ 3. Complete Obsidian Knowledge Vault Integration (`obsidian_control`)
* **Note Management**: Search notes (`search`), read specific note sections/headings (`read`), view active note (`active`), create clobber-proof notes (`create`), and open notes in Obsidian (`open`).
* **Vault Structuring**:
  * `progress`: Logs timestamped progress bullets under `# Progress Log`.
  * `append`: Adds text under any named heading.
  * `link`: Injects `[[wikilinks]]` under `# Related` to dynamically build knowledge graphs.
  * `moc`: Generates Map of Content index notes.
  * `diagram`: Injects native Mermaid flowchart diagrams.
  * `tags`: Lists vault tags with item counts.
* **Focus Mode**: Toggle deep-work Focus Mode on/off (`focus on`, `focus off`) and perform single-target note filing.
* **Autonomous Vault Architect (`organize`)**: Hands raw unstructured notes, meeting transcripts, or clipboard dumps to the deep reasoning pass. Automatically plans multi-note graphs, authors note bodies, injects contextual `[[wikilinks]]`, builds MOC index notes, and injects native Mermaid diagrams without requiring manual prompts.

#### 🎨 4. Generative AI Content Creation Suite
* **AI-Generated Google Docs (`docs_control|generate`)**: Provide a title and a brief — Gemini drafts the entire document body as clean, formatted plain text.
* **AI-Generated Google Sheets (`sheets_control|generate`)**: Describe the dataset you need — Gemini composes structured spreadsheet data with headers and formulas.
* **AI-Generated Google Slides (`slides_control|generate`)**: Give a topic and optional slide count — Gemini produces complete multi-slide presentation decks with titles and body content.
* **AI-Generated Email Drafting (`gmail_compose|generate`)**: Describe the email you want — Gemini writes the body, fills the compose window for your review. Never auto-sends.
* **Multimodal Word AI Drafting (`office_control|word|generate`)**: Generates complete, multi-page professional Word documents with hierarchical styling (Heading 1/2, bullet lists, executive summaries), plus an automated visual research pass that scans every section, queries image search engines, downloads relevant assets, and embeds them directly under their corresponding headers.

#### 📑 5. File-to-Document Generative Ingestion (`file_to_doc`)
* **Massive File Ingestion**: Ingests massive local files (PDFs, research papers, local code repositories, transcripts).
* **Structured Workspace Synthesis**: Extracts core themes and automatically structures and formats clean, production-ready Google Docs.

#### 🛡️ 6. Self-Governing Reliability-Streak Autonomous Trust Protocol (`reliability.py`)
* **Supervised Confirmation Streaks**: Tracks consecutive successful human confirmations per action type to build a trust ledger (`action_reliability.json`).
* **Autonomous Execution**: Unlocks safe, unattended execution for routine tasks once a 3-time supervised confirmation streak is cleared.
* **Automatic Demotion**: Any failure immediately resets the streak to 0, demoting the action back to probation to protect the user.

#### ⚡ 7. High-Throughput Dedicated Compute & Hosted Acceleration
* **High Daily Token Allowances**: Priority Anthropic Claude Sonnet/Opus head model with high daily budget allowances (default $25.00/day).
* **Hosted Servant Fallback**: High-speed hosted servant acceleration (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct on Together/Fireworks) for rapid code reductions and sub-task drafting.

## 4. 🧪 Beta Tier (Early Tester Preview Tier)

*A lightweight trial and evaluation tier designed for early testers running on free API quota. It provides the full everyday Free tier foundation along with safe, read-only inspection previews of Office and Developer tools — keeping tester environments completely quota-safe and non-destructive.*
